new project:
- find martinotti cell traces in blue brain project data
- e.g. curated data: animal 51, i can go through these websites: http://microcircuits.epfl.ch/data/released_data/A51.txt

- som:1, vip:0, pv:0, note others

- i want to merge the single recordings per animal and therefore looked at if the current and voltage levels are the same. here I note for which animals it's not the case:
	- non-matching animals:
		- A77: two groups for currents but voltages almost all different
		- B80: voltages start from -68 to -72
		- B3:  voltages start from -70 to -76
		- B22: voltages end from -68 to -74
		- E87: voltages start from -67 to -76
		- D22: voltages end at -54 and at -60
